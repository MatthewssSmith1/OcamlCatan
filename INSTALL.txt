We require the installation of the graphics package which can be done by
running "opam install graphics" if not already.
Our system can be installed just by downloading the code and running the
appropriate make commands.
We do require the installation of the ANSITerminal package which can be done by
running "opam install ANSITerminal" if not already.
Since we are not implementing player interaction until MS2, we recomend
importing the files into utop in order to interact with the game state.
The following commands are supported:
  make - builds the project and imports it all into utop 
  make build - builds the project
  make play - builds project and runs main function, creates new board and 
              displays it
