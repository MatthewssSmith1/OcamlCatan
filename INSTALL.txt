We require the installation of the graphics package which can be done by
running "opam install graphics" if not already. There are some issues with using
the Graphics module with the built in terminal on certain systems so the 
installation of xterm might be required.
Our system can be installed just by downloading the code and running the
appropriate make commands.
The following commands are supported:
  make - builds the project and imports it all into utop 
  make build - builds the project
  make play - builds project and runs main function, starts a new game instance
  make docs - builds the project and generates public documentation
